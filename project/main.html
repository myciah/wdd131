        Who doesn't want to have fun? No one, and that is why
        cosplay if for everyone. Cosplay is so fun in the 
        aspect that you can learn so many new skills such
        as sewing, foam and leather work, and even things 
        such as 3d printing. Cosplay is a fun way that one 
        can develop their talents and grow as a person. Though
        you don't only have to make a cosplay for yourself, you 
        can also dress up pets which just adds to the fun!</p>
