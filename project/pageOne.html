        <h2>How Does One Get Into Cosplay?</h2>
        <p>That is a wonderful question. When you look at cosplay
            as a whole it can be scary, especially with all the different
            elements to it. Though, one can simply start out by buying
            a cosplay they like. There is no shame in that. Though, if one 
            wants to start building their own but doesn't know where to start
            then it is important to break the cosplay into sections of patterns.
            Cosplay revolves heavily on patterning out everything and making sure it fits.
            There are many patterns that can be bought online that can be altered
            to look in the way you want. Patterning can seem like a scary thing, but if you break
            it down and work on it little bits at a time then slowly you will see progress
            getting made. Along with this, you can pattern things directly to yourself by
            covering yourself in cling rap and duck tapping over it and drawing directly on the ducktape.
            This sounds crazy but it works very well. Then after you pattern what you want out you can start
            the building process. In which if you need help knowing how to build or craft a 
            certain part of the cosplay there are so many tutorials online that can help.

        <h3>What do you do When you Finished a Cosplay?</h3>
        <p>Conventions are very fun to go to as they are a great way
            to showcase the masterpiece you just created. There are so 
            many fun things to do at conventions. You can wander around
            and look at so many different things such as art or items that you can buy.
            Conventions are also a great way to make friends. Conventions are a great place
            to just be yourself. Conventions are a judgement free zone as everyone that is there 
            just wants to have a fun and good time. So when you finish a cosplay, 
            go to a convention and have fun till your hearts content!!!!
